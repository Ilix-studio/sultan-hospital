// fix: A bug fix
// style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
// refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
// perf: A code change that improves performance
// test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
// chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
//like this
